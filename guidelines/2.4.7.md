# Focus visible

## When people press the Tab key to navigate through the interactive elements on the page, make sure they can see which element has the keyboard focus.

It should be easy to tell which element has [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus).

## Requirements

- When interactive elements receive the [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus), their visual appearance must change. For example:
  - an outline could appear around focused elements;
  - links could become underlined;
  - the text or background colour of the element could change.

### Why?

- Sighted keyboard and switch device users track where they are on a page as they navigate through focusable elements, similar to using a remote control with a TV interface.

### How does this work?

See Rob Dodson explain 'Focus rings' in this short video:

<div class="video_container">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ilj2P5-5CjI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

### Related requirement

- See the ['Non-text contrast'](./1.4.11.md) requirements about the contrast of the [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus) indicator.

---

## Common mistakes

### The keyboard focus indicator has been suppressed.

Some sites suppress the browser's default focus indicator (using `outline: 0` or `none`), without replacing it with a better focus indicator.

#### Failure example: Jet2Holidays

<div class="video_container">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hdiLIy0YUpY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

## Guidance for Design

- Do not remove the browser's default focus indicator unless you're also providing an alternative [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus) indicator.
- It's also better include enhanced focus indicators in your designs, rather than relying on the browser's default focus indicators.
  - This is most browsers' default focus indicators have poor contrast (except for Edge and Chrome).

## Guidance for code

### Do not disable focus styles, unless you've already implemented improved focus styles

By default, native HTML elements have a visual focus indicator provided by the browser. Therefore, links and focusable elements must not have their outline suppressed via CSS, unless a custom focus indicator is provided.

#### Failure example

```html
// Never do this, unless you’ve already replaced the default focus outline with
better custom focus styles!

<head>
  <style>
    a /* or a:focus */ {
      outline: none; /* or outline: 0;*/
    }
  </style>
</head>

<body>
  <!--  -->

  <a href="...">Next</a>
</body>
```

#### Good example

```html
// Doing `outline: none` or `0` is fine is you're replacing the browser default
focus outline with better styles.

<style>
  a:focus {
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.2rem ff40b8;
    outline: none;
  }
</style>

<!--  -->

<a href="...">Next</a>
```

### To prevent your enhanced keyboard focus styles from appearing when users click on interactive elements, use the [`:focus-visible` polyfill](https://wicg.github.io/focus-visible/explainer.html)

<!-- #### What's the use case? -->

Browsers' default focus styles don't appear when people click or tap buttons or links.
However, if you define your own enhanced styles using the CSS `:focus` pseu-do class, those styles will appear on click/tap as well.

Sometimes clients or designers don’t like to see a focus ring appear on a custom button or element when it gets clicked.
They might say to a developer: “Get rid of that focus ring”.

But if you got rid of focus rings entirely, the interface would become unusable for keyboard users.

<!--
#### How the `:focus-visible` CSS selector solves that problem

Using the `:focus-visible` CSS selector allows you to …

- disable focus ring styles on elements when they are focused via mouse / touch
- … while leaving them intact when that element gets focused using the keyboard or in code.

In itself, `:focus-visible` doesn’t have any accessibility benefit. Just keeping the focus visible for all users is fine from an accessibility perspective.
But it’s a good way to handle clients or designers’ requests for the focus ring to be removed for mouse or touch users, which would disable keyboard users.

#### You need a polyfill to use `:focus-visible` -->

As of Feb 2020 `:focus-visible` is only supported by default in Firefox.
But the [`:focus-visible` polyfill](https://wicg.github.io/focus-visible/explainer.html) is small and robust.

## More info

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.4.7 Focus Visible:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible.html) Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible. (Level AA)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible.html) with techniques and examples.
