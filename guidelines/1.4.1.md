# Use of colour

## Does the page use colour to convey information?<br />&rarr; Also communicate that information in a way that doesn't assume people can distinguish colours.

Do not use colour as the only way to convey any piece of information.

For example, don't use colour alone to:

- identify form fields with invalid entries;
- distinguish between lines on a graph;
- identify the current step in a step indicator;
- distinguish between areas of a map.

## Requirements

### General requirement

- Colour alone must not used as the only way to communicate a piece of information. Additional visual cues must be used used to provide the same information (like icons, shapes, patterns, text, ...).

### How this applies to infographics

- Information graphics and charts that use colour as a key also provide distinctive non-colour differences (like hatching patterns or directly applied labels).

### How this applies to links in a paragraph of text

- Links in a paragraph of text must not be indicated by colour alone. They must be indicated by another visual indicator as well (like an underline or an icon).

  - Ideally that other visual indicator is present all the time, not just when users hover the link with their mouse. (Because touchscreen users don't use a mouse).
  - If that's not possible, this is less usable and accessible but still meets the guidelines:

    - Make sure the contrast ratio between the colour of the link and the colour of the surrounding text is at least 3:1;
    - And add another visual indicator (for example an underline) when they are hovered by the mouse and receive [keyboard focus](./definitions.md#keyboard-focus).

  - If you use underlines to communicate the presence of links, make sure that no other text on the page is underlined.

### Why?

- This ensures that people who are unable to see colours, or who have difficulty telling different colours apart, understand the content and user interface.
- Colours can be difficult to distinguish in bright sunlight.
- Screen readers do not detect colour.
- Some users will change colour settings for their whole computer, such as applying a tint to help with reading.

## Common mistakes

- Using colour alone to indicate that the user forgot to fill in a text input, or tick a box.

<figure>
  <figcaption>
    I'm asked to tick the checkboxes in red. Nothing apart from colour indicates which checkbox I should tick.
  </figcaption>

  <img src="../assets/141 failure - patchwork checkbox.jpg" width="320" alt="">
</figure>

<figure>
  <figcaption>
    If I have protonopia (a form a colour deficiency), the 'red' checkboxes look grey to me, and it's hard to know which ones are the 'red' checkboxes.
  </figcaption>

  <img src="../assets/141 failure - patchwork checkbox - protonopia.jpg" width="320" alt="">
</figure>

- Using colour alone to indicate that the user didn't fill in text input correctly.

- A form uses only colour to indicate a required field.
- Colour-coding text or backgrounds to indicate essential content, pass/fail categorisation, etc.
- Links are only distinguished from plain text by colour and the colour may not vary from the main body text.
- Text alternatives that do not include information conveyed by colour differences in the original image.

## Guidance for Design

Colour is often used to show:

- a tab is selected,
- a link is available,
- text is an error message,
- emphasis,
- charts and graphics, or
- other meaningful information.

Additional visual and non-visual methods of identifying information or meaning must be applied to complement the use of colour:

- Visual cues could be:
  - text complementing colours;
  - text styles (such as underline, bold or italic);
  - patterns (in graphs or infographics, for example);
  - icons with suitable alternative text;
  - border-with changes (to identify that a text input field is in focus, for example);
  - ...
- Non-visual cues, which are programmatically available to assistive technologies, could be:
  - visually hidden text;
  - HTML element tags (such as `aria-disabled` for the Web);
  - suitable ['Accessible Names'](./definitions.md#accessibility-name) for elements;
  - ...

### How to style links

- It's best for all links within blocks of text to be underlined, and no other content on the page to be underlined.
- If links cannot be underlined and are identified via colour alone, the contrast ratio between their colour and the colour of the surrounding text is at least 3:1, and their visual appearance changes (e.g. they become underlined) when they receive the mouse hover and keyboard focus.
  - Note that this method doesn't help users using touch screen devices
- Links in a navigation menu do not need underlining, as their presence of a navigation menu makes it obvious that they're links.

## More info

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.4.1 Use of Color:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html) Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html) with techniques and examples.
